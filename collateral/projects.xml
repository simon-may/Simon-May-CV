	<Project_Description>Proof of viability

			<P>The overall programme of work was to implement systems which would provide KPN Mobiel with a much better view of, and a much closer relationship with, its customers.
			</P>

			<P>I was asked to project manage a 'proof of viability' project to establish for senior KPN Mobiel management that the solution which had been proposed by KPN's internal architecture group, could actually be made to work.

I've now been working at Novacroft for nearly two years

I am on the same salary that I started on
I have been passed over for promotion
I have asked for training ( Prince 2 ); I have received none
I have been declined a bonus
I have been disciplined
I have asked for different experience ( account manager ); this has not happened
I have received no training
I have been consistently sidelined, and marginalised
